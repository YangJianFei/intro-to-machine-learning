Introduction to Machine Learning

## Installation Notes
This tutorial is using the following packages:

- Python version 2.7.6
- `numpy` version 1.9.2
- `scipy` version 0.15.1
- `matplotlib` version 1.3.1
- `scikit-learn` version 0.16.0
- `ipython` version 3.1.0, with notebook support

Alternatively, check [Installing scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/dev/install.html) out. It provides a good instruction to get scikit-learn installed in different ways.

I also provide a `Vagrantfile` with a bootstrap script in case someone wants to try on an Ubuntu box.
